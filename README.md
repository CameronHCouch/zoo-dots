# Zoo Dots
## Background
Zoo Dots is a game where users match neighboring animals of the same species. Using only horizontal and vertical lines, players draw a continuous line between two or more neighboring animals, earning points equal to the number selected. Selected animals disappear and the game board shifts down to replace them, with new animals falling from above. If a player makes a 2x2 square, every dot of that color is removed from the board.

There are multiple game modes:
Timed games last for one minute.
Infinite games run until the board is out of moves.
(Bonus: Limited move rounds run for a fixed number of turns.)
